## Init and desktop agnostic "yad" based Logout/Exit dialogue.        ##
##                                                                    ##
## Written in response to the seeimingly widely held belief that      ##
## 'systemctl' is what you _have_ to use for power operations if you  ##
## have systemd, regardless that dbus calls are arguably superior.    ##
##                                                                    ##
## Since systemd users like systemd specific commands so much, here's ##
## a system exit dialogue that uses systemd's calls for every power   ##
## or session control action, while remaining compatible with         ##
## non-systemd systems.                                               ##
##                                                                    ##

### Usage ###
USAGE="\nwbl-exit [OPTION]\n\n\
With no arguments default yad (GUI) or text menu at a TTY\n\n\
Only one argument is read, they cannot be combined\n\
    -h --help\tShow this help\n\
    -k --lock\tLock screen\tDoes not work for a tty session\n\
    -l --logout\tLogout\t\tAlso works for tty.\n\
    -s --suspend\tSuspend\tState determined by ACPI S0 S1 or S3\n\
    -i --hibernate\tSuspend to Disk\tRequires enough swap to store RAM\n\
    -y --hybrid\tHybrid Sleep\tACPI must support sleep state S3\n\
    -b --reboot\tReboot\n\
    -p --poweroff\tShut down\n\n\

NOTE: Screen locking is done via swaylock, and only available if
called directly as 'blw-exit --lock'.
"

lock_tty_msg="Error: Graphical environment needed for screen locking.
It can be done with the vlock package installed, using the
command 'vlock'. This script does not handle that case.
If you have a graphical environment running the probable cause
of seeing this message is that no display manager is installed.
An alternative screen locker can be set in
$HOME/.config/bunsen/bl-lock with the following line:
LOCK_SCREEN_COMMAND=\"what-locks-screen --options\"
"

# Some screen locking software does not listen for logind calls,
# screen locking then fails, for such screen lockers set
# LOCK_SCREEN_COMMAND="what-locks-screen  --now"
LOCK_SCREEN_COMMAND="blw-swaylock.sh"
# Known tested examples: "i3lock", "slock", "xsceeensaver-command -lock"
