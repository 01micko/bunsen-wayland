.TH "BUNSENLABS-WL-SESSION" "1"
.SH "NAME"
bunsenlabs-wl-session \(em Starts a BunsenLabs Wayland session.

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
\fBbunsenlabs-wl-session\fR runs a BunsenLabs session, calling a compositor
and starting the necessary auxiliary applications.
There is no full session manager, so you will not be able
to save your state from one log in to the next.
Although labwc is the default BunsenLabs compositor,
users can select others while continuing to use the BunsenLabs
menu, keyboard shortcuts and autostarted applications (see below).
.PP
\fBbunsenlabs-wl-session\fR does not take any command line
arguments.
.PP
\fBbunsenlabs-wl-session\fR is set as the Debian alternative "wayland-session-manager"
so it will be run by default in a Debian wayland session, and a .desktop file
is installed to /usr/share/wayland-sessions so it can be started by a display manager like LightDM.
.PP
On log in, \fBbunsenlabs-wl-session\fR will run the
~/.config/bunsen/autostart-wl script if it exists, and will copy in the
default file from /usr/share/bunsen/skel/.config/bunsen/autostart-wl otherwise. You may
place anything you want to run automatically in this file, for example:

.PP
.RS
.PP
.nf
waybar &
.fi
.RE
.PP
Make sure that each command that does not return quickly is followed by a "&" or else the script will
stop there and further commands will not be executed. You can use the
/usr/share/bunsen/skel/.config/bunsen/autostart-wl file as an example for creating your
own.
.PP
.SS "Compositor:"
Users can choose another compositor than the
default labwc by editing the line:

.PP
.RS
.PP
.nf
compositor=labwc
.fi
.RE
.PP
near the top of ~/.config/bunsen/autostart-wl. In such cases they will
probably want to adjust the autostarted applications, likely with a
new "case" clause for the new compositor. (See autostart for examples.)
